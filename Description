Op Amp Description 
This is a two-stage operational amplifier (opamp) with a differential input pair, a gain stage(common source stage), and a compensation capacitor for stability.

1. Power Supply:
-> We are using dual power supply ,this means the op amp operates with a 3.6 V supply range.

2.  Differential Input Stage:
i . M1 (0.54/0.2)​ and M2 (0.54/0.2):
-> These are NMOS transistors forming the differential input pair.
-> They receive differential input signals (Vin+ and Vin−​).
-> The current source M8​ provides the tail current, which splits between M1and M2

ii. M3 (2.7/0.5) and M4 (2.7/0.5):
-> These PMOS transistors act as active load current mirrors.
-> They ensure proper differential-to-single-ended conversion.

iii. Gain for this stage  : Av1 ​= gm1​⋅(ro3​∣∣ro1​) = 40 dB or 100 V/V

3. Gain Stage :
-> M5 (0.81/ 0.18)   ​: Acts as a current source to bias the second stage.
-> M6 (10.92/ 0.18) :
->This PMOS transistor provides gain in the second stage.
-> It drives the output Vout​ while being loaded by M7​. 

 Gain for this stage : Av2​ = gm6​⋅(ro6​∣∣ro7​) = 30 dB or 30 V/V

4. Output Stage :
-> M7 (2.52/ 0.18): Acts are common source amplifier providing additional gain and drives the load.

5.  Compensation :
-> CL = 10pF : Load capacitance 
-> Cc = 3pF  : Miller compensation capacitor, used to ensure stability and avoid oscillations.

6.  Why we use this particular opamp?
This two-stage CMOS operational amplifier is chosen for its balance between high gain and stable frequency. It is widely used in low-power, low-voltage applications.
